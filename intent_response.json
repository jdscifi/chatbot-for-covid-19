"transmition": "COVID-19 usually transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne\n particles containing the virus. People present in close proximity have the highest risk \nof breathing but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors.\n It can also occur if splashed or sprayed with contaminated fluids in the eyes, nose or mouth,\n and rarely via contaminated surfaces.",
"food": "Currently there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19.\nFoodborne gastrointestinal (GI) viruses, like norovirus and hepatitis A, can make people ill through contaminated food.\nSARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is a virus that causes respiratory illness.\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 can be killed at temperatures similar to that of other known viruses and bacteria found in food.\nThere are currently no confirmed cases of COVID-19 or its new variants being spread through food or food packaging.\nFollow safe operations guidance from your local public health authority and make sure people keep\n at least 2 metres apart if they have to line up for services",
"climate": "There is no evidence of a direct connection between climate change and the emergence or transmission of COVID-19 disease.\nAs the disease is now well established in the human population,\n efforts should focus on reducing transmission and treating patients.\nCoronaviruses die very quickly when exposed to the UV light in sunlight.\nLike other enveloped viruses, SARS-CoV-2 survives longest when the temperature is at room temperature or lower, and when the relative humidity is low (<50%).\nEvidence suggests corona virus can live on objects and surfaces\nfrom a few hours to days, depending on the type of surface.",
"vaccine": "The flu shot will not protect against COVID-19, but it will help\n reduce your risk of getting the flu and COVID-19 at the same time.\nHaving both illnesses at the same time could put you at a higher risk for severe complications.\nAfter getting vaccinated, it's common and normal to have temporary side effects. These can last a few hours to a few days after vaccination.\nVaccine requires 2 doses for maximum protection.\nThe dosing schedule approved by Health Canada is to give the\n2 doses 4 to 12 weeks apart, based on evidence from clinical trials.",
"symptons": "Signs and symptoms include respiratory symptoms and include fever, cough and shortness of breath.\nIn more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe\n acute respiratory syndrome and sometimes death.\nStandard recommendations to prevent the spread of COVID-19 include frequent cleaning of hands using\n alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water; covering the nose and mouth\nwith a flexed elbow or disposable tissue when coughing and sneezing;\n and avoiding close contact with anyone that has a fever and cough."
